# Database-Management-Systems

Throughout the course of Database Management Systems I was practising to write SQL queries (see [**Task-I**](https://github.com/FasterThanC/Database-Management-Systems/tree/main/Task-I)), as well as created a database of a fictional IT company (see [**Task-II**](https://github.com/FasterThanC/Database-Management-Systems/tree/main/Task-II)). 

The course is based on PostgreSQL.
